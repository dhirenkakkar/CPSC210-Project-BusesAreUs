# CPSC210-Project-BusesAreUs

Developed in: Java (IDE: Intellij IDEA CE)

For this project, I completed an Android application called Buses Are Us. A layout code was provided by 
University of British Columbia and my contribution to the code was completion of certain tasks provided by 
the course instructor.

This application mapped the location of stops, buses and bus routes on the Greater Vancouver Transit system 
and retrieved real time arrival information of buses at those stops. It also plotted the user's location on the map 
and highlighted the nearest bus stop. To do this, the app made use of TransLink Open API service.

Relevant topics tested and individually coded:

Phase 1: July 23 - July 31 2017
- Class modeling and implementation
- Parsing TransLink data - text files, JSON files.
- Implementing exceptions on both normal and parser classes.
- JUnit testing on both normal and parser classes.

Phase 2: July 31 - Aug 07 2017
- Implementing instructed methods and classes to operate on android.sdk and android emulator(Genymotion).
- Introduction to OSMBonusPack Javadocs and usage of its Polyline Class.
- Introduction to OSMDroid Javadocs and usage of its ItemizedIconOverlay object.
- Use of API to produce the URL used to query the Translink web service
